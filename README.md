## MSc Artificial Intelligence: Neural Networks and Deep Learning Weekly Lab Tasks

## Overview
The weekly lab tasks and solutions for the neural networks and deep learning module of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence programme at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) School of Computing and Information Science.

Labs are practical exercises that helps you get hands on experience to understand neural networks better along with machine learning concepts and its related technologies. It is organized to promote reproducibility of neural networks research, following nearly academic practices around documenting and submitting any work out to the scientific community.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
```
├── LABLOGBOOK (MOD006568)
├── Week1_LabLogBook.docx
├── Week2_LabLogBook.docx
├── Week3_LabLogBook.docx
├── README.md             # Overview of the repository
